Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance gameTop/graphicEngineVGA/backBufferRestoreMemories_1/RamInitSpWf/RAM_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance gameTop/graphicEngineVGA/backBufferShadowMemories_0/RamSpWf/RAM_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance gameTop/graphicEngineVGA/backBufferShadowMemories_1/RamSpWf/RAM_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
